## Optional: Frontend Assets (Not Required)

The application uses Tailwind CSS via CDN and is fully functional without building assets.

If you want to use Vite for asset compilation (optional):
```bash
# Fix npm permissions (if needed)
sudo chown -R $(whoami) ~/.npm

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run dev server (optional)
npm run dev

# Or build for production
npm run build
```

**Note:** The application works perfectly without npm/Vite as views use Tailwind CSS CDN.
